# ECE-562 TeamB Final Project

## How to use code:
For the KNN Median Filter source separation method, run the script KNN_MedFilt_main.m and it will prompt for a music file. Upon selecting it, the program will proceed to estimate the vocal and instrumental components of the mixed music track. The RPCA source separation method is run using the script RPCA_SS_main.m and it works the same way as the KNN script.
